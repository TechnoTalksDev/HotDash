## Setup & Running the app
Currently there is no demo but it's really simple to setup and see for yourself!
1. Install Dependencies
    - Install node and npm
    - Clone the repo
    - Run `npm install` in the repo directory
2. Build the app
    - Make sure your in the repo directory
    - Run `npm run build`
    - A new folder called `/build` will be created with the built app
3. Run with node
    - Build the app
    - Run `node {build directory}`
    - Make sure the `{build directory}` points the build folder
    - The default port should be `3000` but can be changed with node
    - Enjoy
